        <button width="200%" class="w3-button w3-block w3-grey w3-left-align full-width">&lt;G1&gt; Treat everyone with respect.</button>
        <div class="w3-dropdown-content w3-border">
          <p>All Teams are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful and professional manner while competing in VEX Robotics Competition events. If a Team or any of its members (Students or any Adults associated with the Team) are disrespectful or uncivil to event staff, volunteers, or fellow competitors, they may be Disqualified from a current or upcoming Match. Team conduct pertaining to <a href="#g1" text-decoration="none">&lt;G1></a> may also impact a Team’s eligibility for judged awards. Repeated or extreme violations of &lt;G1> could result in a Team being Disqualified from an entire event, depending on the severity of the situation. </p>
          <p>Robotics competitions often induce intense, high stress situations. These are good opportunities to model and/or gain experience in handling these situations in a positive and productive manner. It is important that we all exhibit maturity and class when dealing with any difficult situations that may present themselves in both the VEX Robotics Competition and our lives in general.</p>
          <p>This rule exists alongside the REC Foundation Code of Conduct. Violation of the Code of Conduct can be considered a violation of <G1> and can result in Disqualification from a current Match, an upcoming Match, an entire event, or (in extreme cases) an entire competition season. The Code of Conduct can be found at <a href="https://www.roboticseducation.org/competition-teams/vex-robotics-competition">https://www.roboticseducation.org/competition-teams/vex-robotics-competition</a>

        <div class="w3-dropdown-content w3-border">
          <p>Adults may assist Students in urgent situations, but Adults may never work on or program a Robots without Students on that Team being present and actively participating. Students must be prepared to demonstrate an active understanding of their Robot’s construction and programming to judges or event staff.</p>
         <div class="w3-red">
           <p>Some amount of Adult mentorship, teaching, and/or guidance is an expected and encouraged facet of VEX competitions. No one is born an expert in robotics! However, obstacles should always be viewed as teaching opportunities, not tasks for an Adult to solve without Students present and actively participating.<br><br>
When a mechanism falls off, it is…<br>
…okay for an Adult to help a Student investigate why it failed, so it can be improved.<br>
…not okay for an Adult to put the Robot back together.<br><br>
When a Team encounters a complex programming concept, it is…<br>
…okay for an Adult to guide a Student through a flowchart to understand its logic.<br>
…not okay for an Adult to write a pre-made command for that Student to copy/paste.<br><br>
During Match play, it is…<br>
…okay for an Adult to provide cheerful, positive encouragement as a spectator.<br>
…not okay for an Adult to explicitly shout step-by-step commands from the audience.

Using Field Element, such as the field perimeter wall, to maintain starting size is only acceptable if the Robot would still satisfy the constraints of &lt;R5> and pass inspection without the Field Element. Robots in violation of this limit will be removed from the field prior to the start of the Match, at the Head Referee’s discretion. </p>

        <div class="w3-dropdown-content w3-border">
          <p>Each Team must include Drivers, Programmer(s), Designer(s), and Builder(s). No Student may fulfill any of these roles for more than one VEX
Robotics Competition Team in a given competition season. Students may have more than one role on
the Team, e.g. the Designer can also be the Builder, the Programmer and a Driver.<br><br>
a. Team members may move from one Team to another for non-strategic reasons outside of the
Team’s control.
<br><br>i. Examples of permissible moves may include, but are not limited to, illness, changing schools,
conflicts within a Team, or combining / splitting Teams.
<br>ii. Examples of strategic moves in violation of this rule may include, but are not limited to, one
Programmer “switching” Teams in order to write the same program for multiple Robots, or one
Student writing the Engineering Notebook for multiple Teams.
<br>iii. If a Student leaves a Team to join another Team, &lt;G6> still applies to the Students remaining
on the previous Team. For example, if a Programmer leaves a Team, then that Team’s Robot
must still represent the skill level of the Team without that Student. One way to accomplish this
would be to ensure that the Programmer teaches or trains a “replacement” Programmer in their
absence.
<br>b. When a Team qualifies for a Championship event (e.g., States, Nationals, Worlds, etc) the Students
on the team attending the Championship event are expected to be the same Students on the Team
that was awarded the spot. Students can be added as support to the Team, but may not be added as
Drivers or Programmers for the team.
<br>i. An exception is allowed if one (1) Driver and/or one (1) Programmer on the Team cannot attend
the event. The Team can make a single substitution of a Driver or Programmer for the
Championship event with another Student, even if that Student has competed on a different
Team. This Student will now be on this new Team and may not substitute back to the original
Team.<br>
Violations of this rule will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, in tandem with the REC Foundation<br>
Student Centered Policy as noted in &lt;G2>, and the REC Foundation Code of Conduct as noted in &lt;G1> </p>
<div class="w3-red">
  Event Partners should bear in mind &lt;G3>, and use common sense when enforcing this rule. It is not the
intent to punish a Team who may change Team members over the course of a season due to illness,
changing schools, conflicts within a Team, etc. Event Partners and referees are not expected to keep
a roster of any Students who has ever driven for a day. This rule is intended to block any instance of
loaning or sharing Team members for the sole purpose of gaining a competitive advantage.</p>

          <p>During a Match, each Team may have up to three
(3) Drive Team Members in their Alliance Station and all Drive Team Members must remain in their
Alliance Station for the duration of the Match. Drive Team Members are not allowed to use any sort of
communication devices while in the Alliance Station. Devices with communication features turned off
(e.g. a phone in airplane mode) are allowed. 
<br><br> Note: Drive Team Members are the only Team members that are allowed to be in the Alliance Station
during a Match.<br><br>Note 2: During a Match, Robots may be operated only by the Drive Team Members and/or by software
running on the Robot’s control system, in accordance with &lt;R28> and &lt;G8>. Violations or refusal to
comply with this rule could be considered a violation of &lt;G1> and is up to the discretion of the Head

          <p>Prior to the beginning of each Match,
Drive Team Members must plug their VEXnet Joystick or V5 Controller into the VEXnet Field
Controller’s Cat-5 cable via their controller’s competition port. This cable must remain plugged in for
the duration of the Match, and may not be removed until the “all-clear” has been given for Drive Team
Members to retrieve their Robots.</p>
<p>Minor violations of these rules that do not affect the Match will result in a warning. Match Affecting
offenses will result in a Disqualification. Teams that receive multiple warnings may also receive a Disqualification at the Head Referee’s discretion.</p>
<p>Note: The intent of this rule is to ensure that Robots abide by commands sent by the tournament
software. Temporarily removing the cable to assist with mid-Match troubleshooting, with an Event
Partner or other event technical staff present and assisting, would not be considered a violation.</p>

          <p>Drive Team Members may only touch the Team’s controls and Robot at
specified times during a Match as per &lt;G9a>. Drive Team Members are prohibited from making
intentional contact with any Game Object, Field Element, or Robot during a Match, apart from the
contact specified in &lt;G9a>.</p>
<p>a. During the Driver Controlled Period, Drive Team Members may only touch their own Robot if the
Robot has not moved at all during the Match. Touching the Robot in this case is permitted only for
the following reasons:
<br>i. Turning the Robot on or off.
<br>ii. Plugging in a battery and/or power expander.
<br>iii. Plugging in a VEXnet Key or V5 Robot Radio.
<br>iv. Touching the V5 Robot Brain screen, such as to start a program.</p>
<p>b. Drive Team Members are not permitted to break the plane of the field perimeter at any time during
the Match, apart from the actions described in &lt;G9a>.</p>
<p>c. Transitive contact, such as contact with the field perimeter that causes the field perimeter to
contact Balls inside of the field, would be considered a violation of this rule.</p>
<p>Minor violations of these rules that do not affect the Match will result in a warning. Match Affecting
offenses will result in a Disqualification. Teams that receive multiple warnings may also receive a
Disqualification at the Head Referee’s discretion.</p>
<p>Note: Any concerns regarding the Ball(s) starting positions should be raised with the Head Referee prior

          <p>a. Teams are responsible for the actions of their Robots at all times, including during the Autonomous
Period. Any infractions committed during the Autonomous Period that are Match Affecting can
result in a Disqualification, if warranted by the rule.</p>

        <div class="w3-dropdown-content w3-border">
          <p>But, be prepared to encounter defense. Strategies aimed solely
at the destruction, damage, tipping over, or Entanglement of opposing Robots are not part of the ethos
of the VEX Robotics Competition and are not allowed. If the tipping, Entanglement, or damage is ruled
to be intentional or egregious, the offending Team may be Disqualification from that Match. Repeated
offenses could result in Disqualification from the entirety of the competition.</p>
<p>a. VEX Robotics Competition Change Up is intended to be an offensive game. Teams that partake
in solely defensive or destructive strategies will not have the protections implied by &lt;G12> (see
&lt;G13>). However, defensive play which does not involve destructive or illegal strategies is still within
the spirit of this rule</p>
<p>b. VEX Robotics Competition Change Up is an interactive game. Some incidental tipping, Entanglement, and damage may occur as a part of normal gameplay without violation. It will be up to the
head referee’s discretion whether the interaction was incidental or intentional.</p>
<p>c. A Team is responsible for the actions of its Robot at all times, including the Autonomous Period. This
applies both to Teams that are driving recklessly or potentially causing damage, and to Teams that
drive around with a small wheel base. A Team should design its Robot such that it is not easily tipped
over or damaged by minor contact.</p>
<p>Note: A Robot which has expanded horizontally in an effort to obstruct the field, or is legally covering
the top of a Goal in a solely defensive manner, should expect vigorous interactions from opponent
Robots. Damage that is caused by opponent Robots pushing, tipping, or Entangling with them would
not be considered a violation of <a href="#g12">&lt;G12></a>. Gratuitous damage or dangerous mechanisms may still be
considered a violation of &lt;R4>, &lt;S1>, or &lt;G1> at the Head Referee’s discretion. </p>

<div class="w3-red">
  <p>&lt;G3> should be used when enforcing this rule. In most cases, if a Robot causes their opponent to break
a rule, the referee will simply not enforce the penalty on that opponent. Only in extreme cases, where

the Robot, should that Robot who caused the opponent to break a rule receive a Disqualification.</p>

        <button width="200%" class="w3-button w3-block w3-grey w3-left-align full-width">&lt;R1&gt; One Robot per Team. </button>
        <div class="w3-dropdown-content w3-border">
          <p>Only one (1) Robot will be allowed to compete per Team in the VEX Robotics
Competition. Though it is expected that Teams will make changes to their Robot at the competition, a
Team is limited to only one (1) Robot. As such, a VEX Robot, for the purposes of the VEX Robotics Competition, has the following subsystems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Subsystem 1: Mobile robotic base including wheels, tracks, legs, or any other mechanism that allows the Robot to navigate the majority of the flat playing field surface. For a stationary Robot, the robotic base without wheels would be considered Subsystem 1. </li>
  <li>Subsystem 2: Power and control system that includes a legal VEX battery, a legal VEX control system, and associated motors for the mobile robotic base.</li>
  <li>Subsystem 3: Additional mechanisms (and associated motors) that allow manipulation of game objects or navigation of field obstacles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the above definitions, a minimum Robot for use in any VEX Robotics Competition event (including
Skills Challenges) must consist of 1 and 2 above. Thus, if you are swapping out an entire subsystem of
either item 1 or 2, you have now created a second Robot and are no longer legal.</p>
<p>a. Teams may not compete with one Robot while a second is being modified or assembled.</p>
<p>b. Teams may not have an assembled second Robot to be used to repair or swap parts to the first Robot.</p>
<p>c. Teams may not switch back and forth between multiple Robots during a competition. This includes using different Robots for Skills Challenge, Qualification and/or Elimination Matches.</p>
<p>d. Multiple Teams may not use the same Robot. Once a Robot has competed under a given team number at an event, it is “their” Robot - no other Teams may compete with it for the duration of the competition season.</p>
<div class="w3-red">
  <p>The intent of &lt;R1a>, &lt;R1b>, and &lt;R1c> are to ensure an unambiguous level playing field for all Teams. Teams are welcome (and encouraged) to improve or modify their Robots between events, or to collaborate with other Teams to develop the best possible game solution. </p>
  <p>However, a Team who brings and/or competes with two separate Robots at the same tournament has diminished the efforts of a Team who spent extra design time making sure that their one Robot can accomplish all of the game’s tasks. A multi-Team organization that shares a single Robot has diminished the efforts of a multi-Team organization who puts in the time, effort, and resources to undergo separate individual design processes and develop their own Robots.</p>
  <p>To help determine if a Robot is a “separate Robot” or not, use the Subsystem definitions found in &lt;R1>. Above that, use common sense as referenced in &lt;G3>. If you can place two Robots on a table next to each other, and they look like two separate legal/complete Robots (i.e. each have the 3 Subsystems defined by &lt;R1>), then they are two Robots. Trying to decide if changing a screw, a wheel, or a microcontroller constitutes a separate Robot is missing the intent and spirit of this rule.</p>

          <p>To participate in an official VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) event, a Team must first register on robotevents.com. Upon registering they will receive their VRC Team Number and four (4) VRC License Plates. Teams may choose to use the VRC License Plate Kit that comes in the VRC Team Welcome Kit, or may create their own, including one made from 3D printed parts. Plates must follow the following requirements.</p>
          <p>a. Robots must use the colored plates that match their Alliance color for each Match (i.e. red Alliance Robots must have their red plates on for the Match). It must be abundantly clear which color Alliance the Robot belongs to. </p><p>Note: If the plates are attached to opposite-color plates, then the incorrect color must be covered, taped over, or otherwise obscured to ensure that the correct Alliance color is abundantly clear to Head Referees during a Match. Since License Plates are considered non-functional decorations, this is a legal non-functional use of tape.</p>
          <p>b. License Plates must fulfill all Robot rules (i.e. they must fit within the 18” cube per &lt;R4>, they cannot cause entanglement, not functionally change the stability of rigidity of the Robot, etc.)</p>
          <p>c. Plates must be at least 2.48 inches (63.2mm) tall and 4.48 inches (114mm) wide, i.e. at least the size of the plates in the VRC License Plate Kit ignoring thickness.</p>
          <div class="w3-red">
            <p>The intent of this rule is to make it very easy for Head Referees to know which Alliance and which Team each Robot belongs to. Being able to “see through” a Robot arm to the wrong color License Plate on the opposite side of the Robot would be considered a violation of &lt;R27a>.</p>
           <p>It will be at the full discretion of the Head Referee and inspector at a given event to determine whether a given custom license plate satisfies the criteria listed in &lt;R27>. Teams wishing to utilize custom plates should be prepared for the possibility of this judgment, and ensure that they are prepared to replace any custom parts with official VEX License Plates if requested. Not bringing official replacement plates to an event will not be an acceptable reason for overlooking a violation of one or more points in &lt;R27>.</p>

          <p>Teams must use a provided “competition template”, or functional equivalent, to accomplish this.

          <p>b. Allow AA batteries to power the robot instead of a VEX 7.2V Battery Pack.
          <p>Note: If an event makes these changes, they must inform all attending Teams. It is especially important that any 75 MHz events make sure their Teams are using the correct communication type.</p>

          <p> A Ball status. A Ball is considered Scored in a Goal if it is not touching a Robot of the same color as the Ball and meets all of the following criteria.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <i>Ball</i> is fully or partially within the outer edge of the <i>Goal</i>.</li>
            <li>The <i>Ball</i> is fully below the upper edge of the <i>Goal</i>.</li>
            <li>The <i>Ball</i> is not contacting the foam tiles outside of the <i>Goal</i>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note: In the act of removing a Ball from the bottom of a Goal with three Scored Balls inside, it is possible for the top Ball to momentarily break criteria 2 above. If this occurs at the end of the Match, this Ball should still be considered Scored. The intent of this note is to avoid unintended de-scoring via the top of the Goal. The intent is not to encourage Teams to seek unique scenarios that would not typically be considered Scored. This would be considered a violation of rule &lt;SG5>.</p>
