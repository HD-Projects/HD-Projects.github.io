               <h2>Open Source Projects</h2>
               <p>
                   Open source projects are a trye of software
                   projects that the developers release all their
                   code for. The definition of open source according
                   to wikipedia is "Open source products include permission
                   to use the source code,[1] design documents,[2] or content
                   of the product. It most commonly refers to the open-source model,
                   in which open-source software or other products are released under an
                   open-source license as part of the open-source-software movement. Use of
                   the term originated with software, but has expanded beyond the software sector
                   to cover other open content and forms of open collaboration.
               </p>
               <h3>These are 3 of the open source projects that we really like</h3>
               <h4>1. Linux - </h4>
               <p>
                 <img src="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ubuntu-17.10-desktop.png" alt="Pic of Linux" class="w3-image" width="500px">
                   Linux is an open source operating system
                   started in 1991 as a personal project by finnish
                   student Linus Torvalds to create a free operating system.
                   This is proboly one of the most well known open source projects
                   of all time. Now there are many Linux Distrubutions Some of the most
                   popular being, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>
                   , and <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a>.
               </p>
               <h4>2. Brave - </h4>

               <p><a href="https://brave.com/hdp272">Brave</a> is a browser that doesn't sell your private data to third parties and that gives you 70% of the ad revenue made from the ads you watch. As a comparison, google sells your personal data to third parties(random companies) and lets you keep a total of 0% of your ad revenue. Make the switch to Brave, protect your online privacy and earn a little bit of money along the way </p>
               <h4>3. Python - </h4>
