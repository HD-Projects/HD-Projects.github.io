<p>Brave is a browser that doesn't sell your private data to third parties and that gives you 70% of the ad revenue made from the ads you watch. As a comparison, google sells your personal data to third parties(random companies) and lets you keep a total of 0% of your ad revenue. Make the switch to Brave, protect your online privacy and earn a little bit of money along the way </p>
