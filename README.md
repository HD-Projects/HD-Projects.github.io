# HD Open Source Projects

This branch is the PHP web server for HD Open Source Projects

## Deployment

We are currently working on tring to get our costom domain set up but for the moment the deployment link is [HERE](hdprojects.rf.gd)

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The official version of the website is [hdprojects.dev](hdprojects.dev)

## Why Are We Doing This

In the future we would like a comment section on most of our pages. When the PHP site is stable and deployed on all of the pages the site will be faster because all of the CSS, JS, and HTML will all be sent in one request therefore making the site faster

## Help The site

Please create a GitHub issue for any bugs or typos and we will sort them out
